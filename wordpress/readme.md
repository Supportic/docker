## Install

- Copy `.env.sample` -> `.env` and adjust variables.
- Place your theme, plugin, mu-plugins inside the wp-dev directory.
- execute `make install`
- go to backend w3-total-cache plugin settings and press skip

### Adding new themes and plugins

The wp-dev directory where you put your source code gets mounted into the home directory of the wordpress container.  
In order to get recognized by wordpress, the themes and plugins will be symlinked into the wordpress directory from inside the container.

Having files in the wp-dev/\* directories will automatically symlink them **when installing the environment for the first time**.  
They stay persistent as long as the wordpress directory exists.

**Adding new themes and plugins** coming from the user inside the wp-dev directory requires to run on the host: `make symlink-docker-create`.  
**Removing themes and plugins** coming from the user inside the wp-dev directory requires to run on the host: `make symlink-docker-remove-user`.  
**Removing leftover symlinks** inside the container requires to run on the host: `make symlink-docker-remove-broken`.  
If you want to make sure all symlinks are in sync (broken,new,current) you can run `make symlink-docker-recreate`.

## Info

WordPress options: https://codex.wordpress.org/Option_Reference

Might need to define PHP variables WP_SITEURL and WP_HOME in the future.

## Add more WP instances to NGINX

- connect wordpress container of new WP instance with same network as NGINX
  ```
  networks:
    nginx-network:
      name: project-name-network
      driver: bridge
      external: true
  ```
- compose.yaml nginx: add additional port to expose on host
- make sure WP_HOME and WP_SITEURL has the correct port (in `.wordpress.env`)
- duplicate nginx conf and change ports

```conf
upstream wpenv2 {
  # docker containers: use hostname
  server project-name-wordpress:80;
}

server {
  listen [::]:3000 default_server ipv6only=on;
  listen 0.0.0.0:3000 default_server;

  location @proxy {
    proxy_pass http://wpenv2;

    proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Host $host:3000;
    proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Port 3000;

    proxy_redirect http://localhost/ http://$host:3000/;
    proxy_set_header   Host $host:3000;
  }
}
```

## Known issues

### w3-total-cache: db.php already exists

[https://querymonitor.com/help/db-php-symlink/#when-an-existing-db-php-file-is-already-in-place](https://querymonitor.com/help/db-php-symlink/#when-an-existing-db-php-file-is-already-in-place)

Query-Monitor creates its own db.php file to improve db queries.  
w3-total-cache also wants to create it's own db.php file but only one may exist in wp-content.

To prevent this on installation there is a mu-plugin which deletes the symlink when it comes from query-monitor.  
The `QM_DB_SYMLINK` variable only replaces the symlink with a real copy. It does not prevent the creation of the file.
